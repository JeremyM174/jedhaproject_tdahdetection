# Welcome to the legacy folder! :older_man:

The content of this folder includes some of our older work files for readability, before Streamlit integration.

This folder is primarily aimed at tech-savvy people, should you want to reuse our work and fine-tune it yourself!

**Make sure** to install locally the libraries found under requirements.txt to avoid version issues.

Recovering them, you will then be able to edit them using your favorite IDE. You will thus find here:
* The three core scripts,
* The CNN notebooks,
* And finally the CNN training files.

Happy coding! :rocket:
